# GitHub Intro

Branching and pairing!

To create a branch we have to use the command: `git checkout -b <branch-name>`

### Pairing Workflow
- Checkout a new branch
- Touch a new file, add content
- git add <file-name>
- git commit -m "meaningful message here"
- git push origin <branch-name>
- open PR with series of green buttons
- delete branch on GitHub
- delete branch locally
